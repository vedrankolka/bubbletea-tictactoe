# Tic Tac Toe!
commandline demo app built using [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for playing tic tac toe in the command line!

Currently, I am working on making it playable with a friend, over a simple TCP connection.

## TODO:
- [ ] initialize connection in main before starting the game
- [ ] randomly decide between X and O
- [ ] handle the TCP moveMsg in Update
- [ ] block playing when it's not your turn
- [ ] add sending of the message upon playing a move
### Advanced features

- [ ] add the other players cursor
- [ ] send cursor moves to the other player
- [ ] receive cursor moves and move the cursor
